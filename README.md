# kicad_projects

In this project, I design the schematic of a device which is used to measure the Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity(SKNA) of a person. This project is the Hardware part of my Research as a graduate Student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
I design the PCB with Kicad Software and develop the firmware with Stme32CubeIDE.
